      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/portfolio-pic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>Born in Cincinnati, Ohio, Amy went to Bowling Green State University immediately after graduating High School from Greenhills High. 
        She received a Bachelor of Science - Computer Science in 1992. Rather than embarking on a programming career, she choose to marry and be a stay-at-home mom
        to 5 children.  When the youngest was old enough for pre-school, in 2005 she started working at IDEXX Laboratories (then called IDEXX Computer Systems).
      </p>

      <p>After a year of working part-time for IDEXX, she was hired full-time as a Software Support Consultant I.  She moved
        up the ranks to Software Support Consultant II and then was hired as a Resource Technician (RT) and Software Support Consultant III.
        This was a high profile position, in-demand with lots of stress. After being an RT for 5 yrs, in 2017, life had a turn of events where she found
        herself in a position to change her life and so moved to Nashville with her daughers.
      </p>

      <p>In Nashville, Amy began working for Trinisys, LLC in June of 2018. Trinisys is a competitive software company that makes software solutions. She has the role of Software Support Analyst. With the support 
        of her company, she enrolled in Vanderbilt Full-stack Coding Bootcamp to fulfill her dream of becoming a software developer.
